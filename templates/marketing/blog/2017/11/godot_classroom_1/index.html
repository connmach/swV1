			      <p>I began using Godot Engine with a group of students. This is a small group of
my most advanced middle schoolers (ages 11-12), with 1+ years of Python
experience. I do an &ldquo;advanced topics&rdquo; class with them every Thursday after school.
They have never used a game engine before.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it went.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Part of the reason for doing this was to get some real-world experience taking
students through the <a href="http://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/learning/step_by_step/your_first_game.html">
&ldquo;Dodge the Creeps&rdquo;</a> tutorial I wrote for the Godot 3.0
documentation. This is designed to be a user&rsquo;s first experience making a project
in Godot, and I wanted to see first-hand where any pain points might be.</p>

<p>This means we are using the Godot 3.0 alpha. It&rsquo;s very stable at this point,
so I feel fairly confident that students won&rsquo;t run into any showstopping bugs
along the way. Fortunately, these kids are happy to be guinea pigs.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>

<p>We started with an introduction to the engine UI and an overview of the concept
of scenes and nodes - the fundamental building blocks of Godot. Since they are
very familiar with Python&rsquo;s object model, they were able to relate the ideas of
a Godot node and a Python object.</p>

<p>Most of the students have at heard of Unity, so there was some discussion of what
a game engine is, closed- versus open-source, and why a developer might choose
one option over another.</p>

<p>Two of the students either didn&rsquo;t hear or were too excited, and didn&rsquo;t click
&ldquo;Create folder&rdquo; when making the new project. That means the project was created
in their home folder. Fortunately, that wasn&rsquo;t too tough to correct, but I&rsquo;m
going to suggest a feature that warns when creating a new project in an non-empty
folder.</p>

<p>As always with students, file management (moving the art assets into the project
folder) was more painful and frustrating than any of the coding ever is.</p>

<p>Some first reactions:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Whoa, this looks complicated!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Cool! It&rsquo;s all black!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="creating-the-player">Creating the player</h2>

<p>The first part of the tutorial is setting up the <code>Player</code> scene. This is an
<a href="http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_area2d.html"><svg width="18" height="18" class="icon-icon_area_2d" target="_blank"><use xlink:href="/blog/img/symbol-defs.svg#icon-icon_area_2d"></svg> <code>Area2D</code></a> with
<a href="http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite.html" target="_blank"><svg width="18" height="18" class="icon-icon_animatedsprite"><use xlink:href="/blog/img/symbol-defs.svg#icon-icon_sprite"></svg><code>AnimatedSprite</code></a>
and <a href="http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_collisionshape2D.html" target="_blank"><svg width="18" height="18" class="icon-icon_collision_shape_2d"><use xlink:href="/blog/img/symbol-defs.svg#icon-icon_collision_shape_2d"></svg><code>CollisionShape2D</code></a>
children.</p>

<p>Adding the children led to a couple instances of this:
<img src="/blog/img/add_child_error.png" width="250"></p>

<p>Students must be reminded to click on the desired parent node <em>before</em> clicking
on &ldquo;Add Node&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Adding the frames to the <a href="http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_animatedsprite.html" target="_blank"><svg width="18" height="18" class="icon-icon_animatedsprite"><use xlink:href="/blog/img/symbol-defs.svg#icon-icon_sprite"></svg><code>AnimatedSprite</code></a>
went smoothly, but it was when adding the collision shape that some problems
started to appear.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/collision_offset_problem.png" width="250"></p>

<p>It is far too easy and unnoticeable to wind up with the children offset and/or
scaled relative to the parent. Nearly every student had trouble with this in one
way or another. When looking at the collision shape, it is much too tempting and
easy to grab the rectangular handles and move/stretch it. When scaling the
capsule shape, if you don&rsquo;t click exactly on the size handle, you wind up moving
the shape instead.</p>

<p>I think that it must be emphasized <em>before</em> adding a child that you probably
want to click the &ldquo;lock children&rdquo; button (which has a very mystifying icon, by
the way).</p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/lock_children.png" width="450"></p>

<h2 id="scripting">Scripting</h2>

<p>Once the player scene was created, it was time to add a script for movement. This
part went very smoothly. I spent a couple of minutes talking about the minor
differences between GDScript and Python (using <code>var</code> to declare variables, and
<code>func</code> instead of <code>def</code> mainly), and we were off.</p>

<p>The kids really liked the IDE. At the beginner level in my Python class, I don&rsquo;t
like to have them use autocompletion, so this was a big plus for them. One
student declared that she&rsquo;s never going to type a whole function name again! They
also liked the real-time error checking.</p>

<p>Nothing in the code itself was a problem for them. Checking for key inputs,
normalizing velocity, and clamping to the screen were all familiar concepts. It
was a big help that I spend a lot of time in my Python class getting them used
to working with vectors, so I didn&rsquo;t need to explain any of that.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up-week-1">Wrapping up Week 1</h2>

<p>At this point we were out of time, so adding the enemies and the UI will have
to wait for next week&rsquo;s class. They really didn&rsquo;t want to stop, which I expected,
and they&rsquo;re all excited for next week. I asked them what they thought so far and
they were all happy with the Godot experience.</p>

<p>Long term, my goal with these students is to work through a couple of projects
together and then turn them loose to develop their own games. Two of the girls
really like working together and I expect they&rsquo;ll want to collaborate on a game,
so we may even touch on some source control and project management topics.</p>

<h2 id="pain-points-for-me">Pain points for me</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dark UI</li>
</ul>

<p>Dark UIs are great, I love them. But in the classroom, it means I did have
to turn the lights off in order for it to be at all visible using the projector.</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolution</li>
</ul>

<p>The Godot editor really likes to have a lot of screen space. My projector has a
native resolution of 1280x800, and that makes things pretty tight, especially
in the code editor. Adding a keyboard shortcut to toggle &ldquo;Distraction Free Mode&rdquo;
was a must.</p>
